        <p>Hello There! My name is Hershraj Niranjani and I am a high school student at The High School at Moorpark College. The school is located in Moorpark, which is about one hour from Los Angeles. I am 16 years old and am currently a <span class="stanford">Stanford</span> Summer Session student, who is visiting the campus until August. I don't exactly know what else to put here because I haven't done things of much significance <span class="italics">yet</span>.</p>
        <p>My dream is to attend <span class="stanford">Stanford</span> University to study computer science, and more specifically, artificial intelligence. Below is a list of my hobbies and interests!</p>
