## CS 193C - Stanford University - Summer Quarter 2022
Hello! Please do not use these files to cheat. If anything, use them as a way to learn!

This repository is meant to be an archive for me to host these files, and show what we worked on!

I doubt you can even use these to cheat. They run stuff through plagirism detection and my code isn't very versatile. It's better to try to do it yourself!

Thanks!
